# Mozilla Open Innovation - Diversity & Inclusion

## Code of Conduct Review Tool

Many open source projects now use a code of conduct ("CoC") to define their standards for community behavior. This resource is intended as a mechanism for both generating, and reviewing a Code of Conduct with three specific goals:

1. Does this Code of Conduct fully describe, and set a project or event up for success in enforcement?
2. Does this Code of Conduct effectively signal this project or event as a welcoming and safe space?
3. Does this Code of Conduct provide guidance for building a healthy project or event?

## How To Use This Resource

This resource can be leveraged to:

*  **Review** your new, or existing Code of Conduct.
*  **Evaluate** the Code of Conduct for other projects and/or events.
*  **Better understand the purpose and goals** of a Code of Conduct.
