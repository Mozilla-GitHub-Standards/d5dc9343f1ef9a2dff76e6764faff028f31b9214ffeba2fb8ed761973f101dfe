Hi, 

This email is to make you aware of a decision regarding [Name],

In recent weeks Mozilla received multiple reports indicating [Name] acted in violation of our Community Participation Guidelines.  
Based on these reports a working group generated recommendations for a 4 week ban From to [Dates] from Mozillaâ€™s projects 
and community. 

These recommendations were validated by a RASCI of Mozilla leadership, and in consultation with our team, and others at Mozilla.

Every effort was taken to ensure the reports were fair, accurate and represented the truth beyond doubt.

We obviously cannot discuss details of the reports, out of respect for everyone involved including. 
Our discretion will ensure an easier transition back to the project in 4 weeks. 
Thank you also for keeping this information confidential,
