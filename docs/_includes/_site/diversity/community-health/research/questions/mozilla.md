##### Mozilla-Participation questions

* By demographic do people also participate elsewhere in the project?
* Do people know about the CPG?
* If so do they trust that it is effectively enforced (and to what percentage)?
* Do contributors believe the CPG as being culturally appropriate and relevant to them?
* Can people describe the relevance of Mozilla/ or project mission in their lives?
