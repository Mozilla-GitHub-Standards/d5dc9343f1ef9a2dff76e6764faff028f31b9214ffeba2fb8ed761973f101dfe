A code of conduct can optionally include other information about
community expectations, and information that helps educate participants
about the use and goals of the code of conduct.

Known problems
==============

Some codes of conduct are poorly structured, contain numerous flags, or
have other warning signs that indicate a lack of enforcement.

There are statements will appear dismissive to people who have
experienced harassment and abuse:

-   “We’re all adults here” — age of participants doesn’t determine
    > whether something causes harm
-   “Be excellent to each other” — this is a cultural reference that not
    > all people will know, and it’s loosely defined
-   “Be nice” — also vague, and puts a higher value on overt politeness
    > over whether harm is caused
-   “Don’t be a dick” or “don’t be an ass” — slang that’s open to
    > interpretation

About intentions — telling community members to assume good or best
intentions is not an effective way to resolve code of conduct issues.
Whether someone intends to cause harm is separate from the impact.

The code of conduct should also not put the burden of response on the
person who has been harmed. Guidelines that tell people to try to
resolve the situation on their own before seeking assistance from a code
of conduct responder are inappropriate.

Be cautious of terms like:

-   Offensive
-   Rude
-   Polite
-   Nice
-   Civil
-   Victim
-   Criminal

All of these can be used to reinforce unequal power dynamics or shame
people away from addressing problems. In addition, whether something is
a criminal or illegal act is separate from whether it is accepted in our
community. Alternate recommendations:

-   Kind
-   Respectful
-   Welcoming
-   Collaborative
-   Appropriate/inappropriate
-   Person who was reported
-   Person who made a report
-   People who were harmed

An assessment of **harm**, **harassment**, or **abuse** should reflect
the impact on the person(s) who it’s directed at. In addition, the
impact on the community as a whole should be taken into account. A
well-worded code of conduct will center these parallel needs.
