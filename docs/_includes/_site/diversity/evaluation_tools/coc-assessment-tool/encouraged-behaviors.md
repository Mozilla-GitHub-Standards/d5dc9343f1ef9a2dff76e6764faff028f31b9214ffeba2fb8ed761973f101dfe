Telling participants what you would like them to do shapes the other
side of community participation. In addition to asking them to report
potential code of conduct problems, the policy can have statements about
community practices for working together.

For example...

> Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on
> PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive
> comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other
> members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all
> who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment
> where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.[^14]
>
> The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community
> members:

> -   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
> -   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
> -   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
> -   Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.[^15]
> In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy,
> we have a small set of social rules we follow.[^16]
