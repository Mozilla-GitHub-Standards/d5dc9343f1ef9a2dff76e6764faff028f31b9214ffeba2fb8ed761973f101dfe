This part of the code of conduct indicates who the policy impacts, and
under which situations. It should be specific enough to address most
questions about whether something is happening within or outside of
community governance.

### Examples (acceptable)

> The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Rust
> venues; including official IRC channels (\#rust, \#rust-internals,
> \#rust-tools, \#rust-libs, \#rustc, \#rust-beginners, \#rust-docs,
> \#rust-community, \#rust-lang, and \#cargo); GitHub repositories under
> rust-lang, rust-lang-nursery, and rust-lang-deprecated; and all forums
> under rust-lang.org (users.rust-lang.org,
> internals.rust-lang.org).[^11]
>
> This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Django
> project or Django Software Foundation. This includes IRC, the mailing
> lists, the issue tracker, DSF events, and any other forums created by
> the project team which the community uses for communication. In
> addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a
> person's ability to participate within them.[^12]

### Encouraged

The minimum scope of the policy should be all normal activities of
project contribution or leadership, including contexts outside the
community where a person is representing the project as a whole. This
may include:

-   commit messages
-   bug trackers
-   IRC channels (listed by name)
-   Email
-   in-person events
-   social media

The statement of scope should be explicit about these spaces and
activities. Other considerations:

-   Make it clear that leaders are held to the same standard as other contributors
-   Define the expectations for employee and volunteer participants, as well as sponsors or other partner organizations.

A statement of scope may mention other contexts where a person’s
behavior affects participation in the project. Some people who wish to
cause harm will try acting just outside the written scope of the code of
conduct, in order to prevent being removed from the community. These are
more difficult situations to respond to, so any extension of scope needs
to be paired with a plan for how it will be monitored and addressed.
It’s reasonable that a code of conduct enforcement team could take
behavior outside the official scope of the CoC into account when
deciding how to respond.

### Red flags

Any policy that explicitly leaves out obvious areas of participation,
like exempting a particular IRC channel or email list, or that defines a
less-stringent standard for some contributors. i.e. This code of conduct does not apply to the core team mailing list.
