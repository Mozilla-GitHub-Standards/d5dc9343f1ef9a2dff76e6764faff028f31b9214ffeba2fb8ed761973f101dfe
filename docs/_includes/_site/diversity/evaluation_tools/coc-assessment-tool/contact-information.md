This should include at least one way of contacting the code of conduct
response team and name the lead responder — names and contact
information can also be included for additional team members,
leadership, or people in an oversight role.

As an example:

You can reach Affect’s Code of Conduct team through:

-   our online reporting form
-   email: coc@affectconf.com
-   text/SMS: the number is provided in pre-conference emails and our opening slides
-   finding a Code of Conduct responder in person[^13]


### Encouraged

Contact methods can include:

-   Email
-   Phone
    -   Voice
    -   SMS
    -   Voicemail systems
-   Other direct messaging on communication platforms (Signal, Slack private messages)

Naming multiple responders who can be contacted helps people address
potential conflicts of interest and find someone they are comfortable
talking to.

### Discouraged

-   Web forms without adequate security (SSL/TLS) and privacy policies displayed
-   Bug trackers
-   Public IRC channels
-   Anything where other people could ‘overhear’ or gain access to the report

### Red flags

Unacceptable communication methods:

-   Public or broadcast systems (i.e. ‘tweet at us’)

Information could be sent in this way but it should not be encouraged.
