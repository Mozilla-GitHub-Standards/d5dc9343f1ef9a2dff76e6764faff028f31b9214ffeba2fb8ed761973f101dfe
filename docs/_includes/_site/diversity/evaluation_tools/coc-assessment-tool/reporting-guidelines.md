Reporting guidelines are an additional piece of information that will
help the community understand how the code of conduct is enforced.
Common elements:

-   Information that will be needed to make a report
-   Further contact details or communication channels for the response team
-   Timelines: when will the reporter have a initial response? How long is the process of resolving an issue expected to take?
-   Steps to the response process
-   Possible resolutions
-   Conflict of interest policy

For example...

> **What happens after you file a report?**
>
> You will receive an email from the DSF Code of Conduct Working Group
> acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt
> within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).[^17]
