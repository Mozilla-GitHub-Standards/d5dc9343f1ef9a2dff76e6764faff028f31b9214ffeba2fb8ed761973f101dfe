**Acceptable (<span style="color:#009900"><em>Green</em></span>)**:

    This CoC contains all of the required elements and
    often uses details from the Encouraged examples. It may or may not
    have items from the Additional Elements.

**Needs Improvement (<span style="color:#FADA5E">Yellow<em></em></span>)**:

    This CoC contains most or all of the required
    elements with a mix of encouraged and discouraged text. It can
    move to Acceptable status by updating any missing elements and
    removing discouraged items. One or two red flags in an otherwise
    acceptable policy would also fall into this category.

**Unacceptable (<span style="color:#992600">Red<em></em></span>)**:

    This CoC is missing significant required elements
    and/or contains a number of red flags. It should be rebuilt from
    scratch rather than updated piecemeal.
